# GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

This project demonstrates an engineering-grade Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline built using GitHub Actions.

The pipeline enforces code quality checks, fail-fast validation, and automated Docker image builds to ensure that only validated code progresses through the pipeline.

This repository focuses exclusively on CI best practices and pipeline design.
